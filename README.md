SpaceTrader
===========
About
-----
This is a muck about project which is purely intended for my own learning. I'm mainly a back-end Java guy but I wanted to play around with GIT, GIThub, jQuery, AngularJS, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3 and some coffee-script. If it's like a lot of other much around projects of mine I can't imagine it ever being completed. Once I've learnt what I've wanted to learn and I've found some other shiny thing to look at, I'll probably move on. Still, I think a web based game like SpaceTrader (I've previously built a WAP/WML based version - back in the day) is a more interesting project to me than 'pet store' so perhaps it will get further than most of my other half-baked learning projects.
